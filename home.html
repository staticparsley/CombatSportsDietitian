            <p>The home of modern evidence based nutrition science for fitness, performance, martial arts and fighting. Assessment
        based recommendations provided with scientifically proven results. Our focus is using the latest research to provide significant
        differences for recovery, energy and performance while optimizing body composition. Superior nutrition for whatever your
        fight is.

        Combat Sports Dietitian.com is a team of Registered Dietitians founded by John Sassone M.S., R.D., a published researcher, author
        and the only registered dietitian in the world who is also a Brazilian jiu jitsu black
        belt and former professional MMA fighter.
        While fighting out of Huntington Beach as a bantamweight on the Southern California pro circuit, John recognized a need
        for sport specific evidence based nutrition. John then completed a Master's of Science Degree in Nutrition with a focus
        on exercise physiology, graduating with a 4.0 GPA out of Cal State Long Beach. John has mastered every aspect of sports
        nutrition for combat sports.

        <p><strong><u>Weightcutting and Fractures in MMA</u></strong></p>
        <a class="research" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217506/">
       <div class="research">High protein diet in rats reduced bone mineral density due to metabolic acidosis, the opposite was found in humans. This is a good example on how animal studies don’t transfer to humans.</div>

<a class="research" href="https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jbmr.2754">
<div class="research">
Unfortunately calcium absorption capacity has been shown to decline with weight loss.

The smaller the person, the thinner the bones. 

Muscle is the primary source of anabolic mechanical stimuli for bone tissue.

Adiponectin, which is inversely associated with fat mass, effects bone mineral density. 

When weight loss stabilizes after one year, bone mineral density is still found to decline up until year 2. 

In general, the weight loss groups have experienced decreases in body weight of 9% to 10% and decreases in BMD of about 2%.

Finally, a disquieting observation from prior studies is that when bone mass is lost during weight loss, it does not seem to be regained in full when weight is regained. This mirrors the observation that the BMD decline during spaceflight and the microarchitectural deterioration sustained during non–weight-bearing after orthopedic surgery do not recover in full after return to normal weight-bearing activity resumes.

<div class="research">
This indicates caloric restriction increase fracture risk and are regulated by endocrine factors and cytokines that have direct and indirect effects on bone and calcium absorption.

The hormones released from meal ingestion appear to have an anabolic effect on bone.

Additionally, a higher protein intake increases Ca absorption, which thus may attenuate the decrease in Ca absorption associated with caloric restriction.

Energy restriction also reduces calcium absorption efficiency

Reduced energy to fracture has also been seen in dehydrated bones, think of toast vs bread.

Acute fractures comprise 5% to 10% of all sports injuries. Overall, MMA is a sport with a high injury rate, with an incidence of 25 injuries per 100 competitive fights. Out of which about 6% are fractures, so this is 1.5% of bouts
